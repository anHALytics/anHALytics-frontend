AnHALytics is a project aiming at creating an analytic platform for the [HAL research archive](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) or other scientific Open Access repositories, exploring various analytic aspects such as search/discovery, activity and collaboration statistics, trend/technology maps, knowledge graph and data visualization. The project is supported by an [ADT Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/research/research-teams/technological-development-at-inria) grant and good will :). 

This module is dedicated to the frontends of the system.
